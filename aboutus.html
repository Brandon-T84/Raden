<p style="color:white;margin-top:400px;">Hello! We are Rayhan and Brandon, and we created Raden. We are two high school students who both enjoy coding. When we were first thinking of what we could create whilst coding, we found that many people struggle with setting their priorities when it comes to managing their money. In fact, this issue is more pressing than ever in the COVID-19 Pandemic. People are still having to pay for things like taxes, bills, food, and transportation while not making the same amount as they normally would. This is something that is extremely important because we believe that everyone should know the difference between their needs and their wants. This is why we created Raden.<p>
